```markdown
# 🎨 All Kind QR Codes Generator

An advanced, feature-rich application to generate QR codes for various data types: contact details (vCard), WiFi credentials, plain text, emails, and more.
## 📱 Supported QR Code Types
| Type | Format | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WiFi Network** | `WIFI:S:SSID;T:WPA;P:Pass;;` | Share your WiFi access securely. |
| **Contact (vCard)** | `VCARD` data | Create scannable digital business cards. |
| **Email** | `mailto:` | Pre-fill recipient, subject, and body. |
| **Plain Text** | Raw text | Encode any textual information. |

## 🧩 Modules & Architecture
This project demonstrates **modular software design**:
*   `generator/core.py` – Base QR generation logic.
*   `generator/formats/` – Specialized modules (wifi.py, vcard.py, etc.).
*   `ui/app.py` – Unified graphical interface (Flask/Tkinter)

## 📖 Abstract
The CPEC Navigator is an **AI-integrated web application** designed to visualize, analyze, and optimize routes along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. It applies **machine learning algorithms** for predictive analysis and optimal pathfinding, serving as a practical tool for understanding infrastructure impact and regional connectivity. This project demonstrates the applicant's ability to apply **artificial intelligence to real-world geopolitical and economic challenges**.

## 🎯 Core Objectives
1.  **Technical Demonstration**: Showcase proficiency in full-stack development, geospatial data handling (`Folium`, `GeoPandas`), and AI/ML implementation.
2.  **Academic Relevance**: Create a research-oriented tool with clear methodology, applicable to regional development studies.
3.  **Practical Solution**: Provide an intuitive platform for students, researchers, and policymakers to interact with CPEC data.

## 🔬 Methodology & AI Components
| Module | Technology / Algorithm | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Route Optimization** | `NetworkX`, A* / Dijkstra Algorithms | Find shortest/most efficient paths between CPEC nodes. |
| **Economic Indicator Analysis** | `scikit-learn` (Linear Regression, Time Series) | Model and predict economic trends along the corridor. |
| **Interactive Visualization** | `Folium`, `Leaflet.js` | Render interactive maps with custom layers (projects, routes). |
| **Backend API** | `Flask` / `FastAPI` | Serve data and handle analysis requests. |
